# BetaGo
BetaGo lets you roll your own go engine, by automatically downloading go games, preprocessing them, training a neural network using keras on data and serving the trained model to a javascript front end, which you can use to play against your very own handcrafted and artisanal Go bot. Feel free to modify and extend any of these steps along the way, and help decrease the gap between AlphaGo and BetaGo. Contributions are welcome!

## Installation
```{python}
pip install betago
```
